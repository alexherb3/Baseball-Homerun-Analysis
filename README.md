# Home Run Analytics Dashboard

Using the given data, I decided to answer which combinations of exit velocity, launch angle, and exit direction most often result in home runs. From there, I filtered only successful home runs to help identify an ideal power zone for hitters. While the dataset had limitations such as not taking into account the stadium which all have different dimensions and having many undefined values (which are either a foul or hit by pitch) the analysis still provided valuable insights within the time I had available.
