# Home Run Analytics Dashboard

Using the given data, I decided to answer which combinations of exit velocity, launch angle, and exit direction most often result in home runs. From there, I filtered only successful home runs to help identify an ideal power zone. Other available columns were considered, but many rows had Undefined values. Looking at the video these were either a foul ball or a hit by pitch, which are two very different outcomes. Since they were lumped together these caused errors and for the sake of time I decided to skip them as they were causing errors.
